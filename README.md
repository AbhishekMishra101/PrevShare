# Priv Share
## Privacy Preserving Data Sharing Platform


## Overview

This project aims to provide a privacy-preserving solution for sharing sensitive data securely among authorized parties. Leveraging Python Flask, it offers a robust web framework for building the platform. With a focus on privacy, security, and ease of use, our platform ensures that sensitive information remains protected throughout the sharing process.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data shared through the platform is encrypted, ensuring that only authorized users can access it.
- **Access Control**: Granular access controls allow data owners to specify who can view, edit, or delete shared data.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Users are required to authenticate themselves before accessing the platform, and their access privileges are strictly enforced based on predefined roles.
- **Data Anonymization**: For added privacy, sensitive information can be anonymized before sharing, protecting the identities of individuals involved.
- **Audit Trails**: Detailed logs are maintained to track all actions performed on the platform, facilitating accountability and compliance with privacy regulations.
- **Customizable**: The platform is highly customizable, allowing organizations to tailor it to their specific privacy and security requirements.
